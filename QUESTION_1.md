My name is Thulane my surname is Tivane. I attended my grade one to grade 12 at Prof ss Repinga Combined School. That means I competed my matric 2017. I completed my matric at Mpumalanga Block B. I had a gap year after competing my matric that means it was 2018. I took a gap because of my family didnâ€™t have money to send me to varsity that was a pain that I will never forget in my life.
During the gap year in 2018 I was hustling and budget that money that I get for 2019 to be in varsity. In 2019 I got accepted at Tshwane University of Technology under the department of ICT in Computer System Engineering. Computer System Engineering showed me the exactly real world of technology and engineering. During my studies I was doing lot of stuff such as software engineering, programming with lot of programming languages such as python, c++, java and many more.
