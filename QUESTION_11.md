# 11. The importance of doing your own work

In your own words please describe:

*	why copying other people’s work is a damn silly idea
Is damn sill idea because copy and paste doesn’t means you have the      information in your mind for future use. When they say do it alone that means you are alone you have to think deep cause they mark they need see amazing different idea from students. Copy is not a good option but ask to understand is a good option for future use.

*	why taking the time to fully understand concepts is a good idea
because when you understand something that means you are investing it will help you in future. When you understand some thing you can lead many people with that understand you have. The are other things that you can’t understand it when you didn’t understand the first one that means you future will stop.
